deluge state files to backup:
- session.state (?? not sure if I need this that much)
- state/*.torrent
- state/torrents.state

deluge secrets for vault:
- auth
- parts of the conf files??
- ssl/{daemon.cert,daemon.pkey} (??)

deluge config for templating:
- core.conf
- web.conf
- plugins/

Also look into removing the 2 sebooleans in torrents for gluetun

How to do reverse-proxy or webserver...

caddy or nginx reverse-proxy-manager as both, they route requests to nextcloud.falkes.net:433 to locahost:9000// port that fpm uses
can I make the service backends use the RP as a web server as well??
