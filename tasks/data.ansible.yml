# TODO: Containerize restic, so I can just use podman secrets flow everywhere
# Make systemd timer but make the associated service for the timer a quadlet .service file
# The quadlet's entry point is restic check, restic backup or restic forget
# Mount data dir readonly, with small z perms and noexec
# Have my timer run each entrypoint as a diff .service/quadlet that run sequentially, depending on prev success?
# Or... my timer triggers a backup_script.service, which runs podman exec ... $entrypoint within the script?
# Former is more complicated and gives me nothing but failures for distinct stages in systemctl --failed
# Also a second timer to check if proton/rclone config is stale and needs to be refreshed. Or refresh unconditionally every N hours?

# Make all users system users this time with no login shell and a home dir on /data drive?
# Then make this backup service in the data user just backup the entire /data drive, including their home dirs
# which will include any state. Some secrets will be in the backups (deluge state includes auth file as is) but that's fine,
# the backups are encrypted.
