deluge state files to backup:
- session.state (?? not sure if I need this that much)
- state/*.torrent
- state/torrents.state

deluge secrets for vault:
- auth
- parts of the conf files??
- ssl/{daemon.cert,daemon.pkey} (??)

deluge config for templating:
- core.conf
- web.conf
- plugins/

^^ deluge secrets into secret manager, config into source control somehow
use my own ssl cert from a secrets manager?

Also look into removing the 2 sebooleans in torrents for gluetun

May 10 18:24:15 nas gluetun[26295]: 2024-05-11T01:24:15Z INFO [wireguard] Using userspace implementation since Kernel support does not exist
Can I somehow enable wireguard support in my kernel for performance?

Would be nice to replace ansible-vault here with podman secrets, bitwarden cli, bitwarden ansible plugin...
Maybe just add to the install script so it calls bitwarden cli?

How to add in protondrive backend?
Requires manual config, 2fa code (6 digit TOTP), rclone selfupdate, etc
rclone config after
Most steps have flags I can pass to cli, only hard blocker is the 2fa thing...
bw cli can fetch 2fa totp code at runtime?

Also, split backup (restic) and sync (pure rclone) steps for protondrive.
Add both as scripts, time them separately so they don't conflict and shred disk IOPS.
Maybe systemd has some idea of exclusive runs in unit files?
